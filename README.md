Hi, I'm Marcelo Mazza — UX veteran, creative technologist, and recovering punk rocker 🇦🇷

🚀 Currently building tools at the edge of design, code, and self-expression.  
🎤 Exploring singing, writing, and automation — and always up for meaningful collaborations.  
🛠️ 20+ years in product, design, and development — from LATAM startups to global platforms (Booking.com, Toptal).  

If you're building something bold, hit “Follow” or check out one of my repos — I do the same when I find someone interesting.
